The goal of sparsenumeric is to provide a simple implementation of sparse vectors in R. Most of the entries in a sparse vector are zero. This package only stores the non-zero elements of a vector and can perform arithmetic on the vectors. 

## Installation

You can install the development version of sparsenumeric like so:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("laurenmaurer4/sparsenumeric")
```
